# Deploy and develop apps in Olares

Studio provides a real Olares environment for building, porting, and testing apps when cloud features and the sandbox system are hard to simulate locally. With Studio you can:
- Create a new Olares app in an online development container.
- Port an existing app, adjust its configurations, and test the installation flow.
  -Package your app into a chart and download it when your app is ready.

## Access Studio
You must manually install Studio:
1.  Open **Market**, and search for "Studio".

2. Click **Get**, then **Install**, and wait for installation to complete.

After installation, launch Studio from Market or from Launchpad.

## Understand the Studio UI
The sidebar and **Home** page organize your main tasks in Studio:
- **Home**: A welcome page with shortcuts to common actions and documentation.
- **Applications**: A list of apps you have created and deployed with Studio.
- **Start**: You can start deploying or developing apps, or uploading an app from a local chart file.
