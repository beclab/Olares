# `bfl`

## Overview

The `bfl` (Backend For Launcher) component is a crucial part of the Olares framework's service architecture. It acts as an aggregator for various backend interfaces, and as a proxy for all system service requests. This simplifies the interaction between the launcher and the backend services, providing a single point of contact and streamlining the overall system design.
