# Manage ComfyUI using ComfyUI Launcher

ComfyUI Launcher is the core management tool of ComfyUI for **administrator users**. You can use it to control the running status of the ComfyUI service within the cluster, while easily managing models, plugins, runtime environment, and network configurations.

This guide walks you through using ComfyUI Launcher for service management and routine maintenance.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Start and stop the ComfyUI service for all users in the cluster.
- Verify and adjust network settings so GitHub, PyPI, and Hugging Face are accessible.
- Install essential models and additional models, and understand where models are stored in **Files**.
- Manage plugins registered in ComfyUI Manager as well as from GitHub.
- Manage Python dependencies by installing, updating, removing packages, and analyzing missing dependencies for plugins.
- Troubleshoot common issues using logs and safely reset ComfyUI to its initial state when necessary.

## Start and stop the service

As the administrator, you must start the ComfyUI service before you or other members can access it via the client interface.

- **Start ComfyUI service**

    Go to **Home** and click the **START** button in the upper-right corner.
    ![Start ComfyUI service](/images/manual/use-cases/comfyui-start-service.png#bordered)    
    
    ::: tip Notes on first run
    - Initial startup of ComfyUI Launcher typically takes 10-20 seconds for environment initialization.
    - If the system prompts that essential models are missing, you can click **START ANYWAY**. However, workflows may fail without these base models. We recommend downloading the essential model package before starting the service.
    :::

- **Stop ComfyUI service**

    Go to **Home** and click the **STOP** button when ComfyUI is not in use. This releases VRAM and memory resources for other applications.
    ![Stop ComfyUI service](/images/manual/use-cases/comfyui-stop-service.png#bordered)   

## Configure network

ComfyUI relies heavily on external resources such as GitHub (plugins), PyPI (Python packages), and Hugging Face (models). Before installing components, verify the connection status in **Network Config**.

1. Go to **Network Config**.
2. Check the connectivity to GitHub, PyPI, and Hugging Face.
3. If any service shows `Inaccessible`, fix your network or proxy settings, and then click **SAVE & CHECK** to test again.
    ![Configure network](/images/manual/use-cases/comfyui-network-config.png#bordered)   
4. Repeat until the status of each service becomes `Accessible`.

## Manage files and directories

ComfyUI Launcher provides quick access to key directories and uses a shared model folder so models can be reused across Olares AI applications (such as ComfyUI and SD Web UI).

### Access file locations

On the **Home** tab, the **File Type** section provides direct access to the five main directories:

- **Root**: Root directory of the ComfyUI installation.
- **Plugin**: Stores installed plugins.
- **Model**: Centralized storage for AI models.
- **Output**: Default destination for images and other assets generated by ComfyUI.
- **Input**: Folder for source images used in image-to-image or in-painting workflows.

Clicking any of these entries opens the **Files** app directly in the corresponding directory.

### Understand the model directory structure

The **Model** directory shown under **File Type** maps to the following path in **Files**:

**Path:** `/Files/External/olares/ai/model/`

When uploading external models manually or selecting a destination in **Custom Download**, it is important to place files into the correct subfolder. The same structure is shared across ComfyUI and SD Web UI:

| Directory in Files | Standard ComfyUI directory | Model type |
| `main/` | `checkpoints/` | Base checkpoints (SD1.5, SDXL, Flux) |
| `lora/` | `loras/` | LoRA weights |
| `vae/` | `vae/` | VAE models |
| `controlnet/` | `controlnet/` | ControlNet models |
| `ipadapter/` | `ipadapter/` | IP-Adapter models |
| `upscale_models/` | `upscale_models/` | Upscalers (ESRGAN, SwinIR) |
| `clip_vision/` | `clip_vision/` | CLIP Vision models (used for IP-Adapter) |
| `unet/` | `unet/` | Standalone UNet weights |
| `text_encoders/` | `text_encoders/` | Text encoder models (T5, CLIP-L/G) |
| `clip/` | `clip/` | CLIP models |
| `embeddings/` | `embeddings/` | Textual Inversion embeddings |
| `hypernetworks/` | `hypernetworks/` | Hypernetwork weights |
| `facerestore_models/` | `facerestore_models/` | Face restoration (GFPGAN, CodeFormer) |
| `inpaint/` | `inpaint/` | Inpainting-specific models |
| `style_models/` | `style_models/` | Style or effect models |
| `diffusion_models/` | `diffusion_models/` | Other diffusion models |
Make sure the model type matches the target folder so that ComfyUI can detect and use the files correctly.

## Manage models

ComfyUI Launcher provides flexible ways to manage models: install the essential package with one click, download from the built-in library or a Hugging Face link, upload directly to **Files**, and delete models when needed.

### Install essential models

Essential models are basic resources required for ComfyUI to run, including SD large models, VAE, preview decoders, and auxiliary tool models. We recommend installing them on the first run.

1. Open the package page in either of the following ways:
    - In the **Missing essential models** prompt window that appears on first start, click **INSTALL MODELS**.
    - Go to **Home**, scroll to the **Package installation** section, find **Stable Diffusion base package**, and click **VIEW**. This package provides the necessary foundation for ComfyUI, including VAEs, utility models, and preview decoders.
    ![Install basic package](/images/manual/use-cases/comfyui-base-package.png#bordered)

2. On the **Package Details** page, click **GET ALL** to start the automatic installation. You can track the progress in the status bar.
