## Overview

MinIO is a distributed storage backend. It can be set up as a MinIO cluster through Olares or an existing one can be mounted. When deploying Olares as a distributed service across different machines, MinIO is used as the data storage backend for JuiceFS, to provide a unified view of the Olares filesystem.
