# `docker-nginx-headers-more`

## Overview

The `docker-nginx-headers-more` component provides a Docker image for Nginx that includes the `headers-more` module. This module allows for more advanced manipulation of HTTP headers than what is available in the standard Nginx distribution, which is useful for fine-tuning the behavior of web applications and services within the Olares ecosystem.

For more information, see the [docker-nginx-headers-more GitHub repository](https://github.com/anroe/docker-nginx-headers-more).
