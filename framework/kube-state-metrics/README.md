# `kube-state-metrics`

## Overview

The `kube-state-metrics` component integrates `kube-state-metrics` into the Olares framework. This service listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of various Kubernetes objects, such as deployments, nodes, and pods. These metrics are crucial for monitoring the health and performance of the Kubernetes clusters within the Olares ecosystem.
