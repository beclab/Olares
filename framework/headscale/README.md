# `headscale`

## Overview

The `headscale` component integrates Headscale, a self-hosted, open-source implementation of the Tailscale control server, into the Olares framework. This allows for the creation and management of secure, private networks for your Olares nodes and services, without relying on the public Tailscale service.
