## Getting started with Olares documentation

We welcome community contributions! Follow these steps to preview, develop, and build the documentation locally.

### Install dependencies

First, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (LTS version recommended). Then, run the following command in the project's root directory to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
````

### Start the development server

Start the local development server with hot-reloading. This allows you to see your changes live in the browser as you edit the source files.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` to see the local preview.

### Build the site locally

To generate a production-ready build for final review or debugging, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will build the static site into the `dist` directory.

## Versioning and branching strategy

To manage documentation for different product versions effectively, we use the following branching strategy:

* **`main` branch**:
  This branch contains the latest documentation for the **next, in-development version** of Olares. All documentation for new features should be submitted here.

* **`release-{version}` branch**:
  These branches hold the documentation for **recent, stable versions**. For example, the `release-1.11` branch corresponds to the `Olares 1.11` documentation. Fixes or clarifications for a specific stable version should be submitted to its corresponding release branch.

Creating a PR to a corresponding branch will automatically trigger the documentation build for that version.

## Style guide

To ensure clarity, accuracy, and a consistent tone, please read our **[Content and Style Guide](https://github.com/beclab/docs/wiki/Markdown-reference)** before contributing.
