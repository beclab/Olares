# Get familiar with Desktop

Desktop is the primary interface for interacting with Olares. From here, you can open and manage built-in system apps as well as the apps you install.

## Desktop basics

### Dock

The Dock is an application quick-launch bar on the left side of the screen. Use it to open frequently used apps and access key Desktop features.

### Launchpad

Launchpad shows all installed applications. Click the **Launchpad** icon in the Dock to open it.

### Application windows

By default, applications open in **window mode** as an embedded page within Desktop. You can manage windows like you would on a standard computer:

- Drag the title bar to move the window.
- Drag the window edges to resize it.
- Minimize, maximize, or close the window.
- Click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">open_in_new</i> to open the app in a new browser tab.

::: tip Note
Some applications only support opening in a browser tab.

### Search and notifications

- **Search:** Quickly launch applications and find supported content across Olares.
- **Notifications:** Click the notification icon to view system and application notifications.

## Use Launchpad

From Launchpad, you can:

- View all installed applications.
- Click an application icon to open it.
- Drag icons to reorder them within Launchpad.
- Drag an icon to the Dock for quick access.

### Uninstall applications

1. Press and hold an application icon to enter editing mode.
2. If a <i class="material-symbols-outlined">close_small</i> icon appears in the top-left corner of the app icon, click it to uninstall the application.

::: tip Note
Built-in system applications such as Files, Market, and Profile cannot be uninstalled.

## Search within Olares

You can quickly open global search using one of the following methods:

- Press the keyboard shortcut: `Shift + Space`
- Click the <i class="material-symbols-outlined">search</i> icon in the Dock.

Global search can find applications, files, and other supported search targets.

| Supported search target | Supported search capability |
|:--|:--|
| Applications (built-in and installed) | Search by application name and open the app directly.| 
| Directories enabled for full-text search | Search files by filename and by text content inside <br>supported documents. |
| Other directories in File manager storage  | Search files by filename only.  |
| Team shared files | Search shared files by filename only. |
| File manager synced drive | Search synced files by filename only. |
| Wise reader content | Search RSS feeds, web pages, and PDFs by name. |

### Configure file search rules

By default, global search searches files by filename only.

To improve search efficiency or enable searching file contents, go to  **Settings** > **Search** > **File Search** to configure full-text search and exclusion rules.

For details, see [Configure file search](/manual/olares/settings/search.md).
