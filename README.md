## Introduction

Terminus OS is a source-available, cloud-native operating system built on Kubernetes, designed to run on edge devices owned by users. Our goal is to enable users to securely store their most important data on their own hardware and access services based on this private data from anywhere in the world.

In essence, we want you to use Terminus OS like a regular computer. We hope that Terminus OS can assist individuals and organizations in managing data, business, and life effectively, all while fully owning and controlling their data.

- For users, we aim to make Terminus OS as easy to use as a smartphone.
- For developers, we strive to provide an experience consistent with that of public clouds.

## Features

Terminus OS offers a wide array of features designed to enhance security, ease of use, and development flexibility, making it a powerful tool for both users and developers.

- [**Enterprise-Grade Security with Ease**](https://docs.jointerminus.com/overview/terminus/network.html)

   Terminus seamlessly integrates Tailscale, Headscale, Cloudflare Tunnel, and FRP, simplifying network configuration while providing enterprise-grade security. Users no longer need to worry about managing domain names, HTTPS certificates, and other details; each service can be accessed in the most secure and convenient way.

- [**Secure and Permissionless Application Ecosystem**](https://docs.jointerminus.com/overview/terminus/application.html)

   Terminus offers a secure and permissionless app ecosystem via sandboxing, ensuring application isolation and security. Developers can freely distribute and run applications without the constraints of traditional app stores.
