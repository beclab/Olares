# Access Olares anywhere

This guide explains **how to reach your Olares from anywhere**. You will learn:

1) The access paths for public vs. private entrances.
2) How to enable LarePass VPN on your mobile and desktop.
3) Interpret connection status and know when to troubleshoot.

## How access works in Olares

In Olares, you access each app or service via its own URL (`https://app.olares-id.olares.com`, for example, `https://desktop.nicholas.olares.com/`). Depending on who should reach it, there are two entrance types.

### Public entrance

  * Accessible to anyone on the internet without authentication. For example, a public blog hosted on WordPress.
  * Traffic is securely routed from the internet to Olares via Cloudflare Tunnel or FRP.

### Private entrance

Application entrances intended only for you, such as Desktop, Vault, and the management console of WordPress. Depending on where you are, there are two scenarios when accessing private entrances:

- **Remote access** (Outside your local network)
  - **With LarePass VPN (Recommended):** Traffic is routed directly and securely through the VPN (Tailscale), no matter where you are.
  - **Without LarePass VPN:** Traffic is routed through the same internet tunnel as public access (Cloudflare/FRP).

 - **Local access** (On the same network)
  
    Use the local URL (`http://app.yourname.olares.local`) for a direct, local connection that bypasses the VPN and internet tunnels.

:::warning Always enable VPN for remote access
For the best experience with private apps when youâ€™re away from your network, enable **LarePass VPN**. It keeps your connection to Olares encrypted, direct, and fast.

## Understand connection status
LarePass displays the connection status between your device and Olares, helping you understand or diagnose your current network connection.

![Connection status](/images/manual/larepass/connection-status.jpg)

| Status       | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Internet     | Connected to Olares via the public internet      |
| Intranet     | Connected to Olares via the local network        |
| FRP          | Connected to Olares via FRP                      |
| DERP         | Connected to Olares via VPN using DERP relay     |
| P2P          | Connected to Olares via VPN using P2P connection |
| Offline mode | Currently offline, unable to connect to Olares   |

::: info
When accessing private entrances from an external environment through VPN, if the status shows "DERP", it indicates that the VPN cannot directly connect to Olares via P2P and must use Tailscale's relay servers. This status may affect connection quality. If you constantly encounter this situation, please contact Olares support for assistance.

## Troubleshoot connection issues
If you encounter connection problems, LarePass will display diagnostic messages to help you resolve the issue. Here are some common scenarios and how to address them:
