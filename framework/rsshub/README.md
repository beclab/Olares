#  `rsshub`

## Overview

The `rsshub` component integrates RSSHub, a powerful and customizable RSS feed generator, into the Olares framework. This allows users to generate RSS feeds from almost any source, making it easier to subscribe to and consume content from various platforms that may not natively offer RSS feeds.
